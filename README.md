The script attempts to reformat CTD data to a file usable in ODV. It creates a file for each input as well as a master sheet combining them. 

It works EXCLUSIVELY for the CTD data format used on the research vessel ALKOR in northern latitudes and eastern longitudes. 

Please remember to download both 
  CTD_extraction.R and angle2dec.R
for the script to work.

Script worked for the CTD data of 30.08.22.
PLEASE CHECK your output for any errors and compare it to the original .TOB file.
Feel free to change the script on your local host.
Suggestions or tips for improvement are always welcome.
